/*
BlackJack is a fairly simple game. There are 52 cards in a standard deck.\nEach card has a value, and nothing is execused in the game.
You have 2 options when playing, you can Stand or you can Hit.\n Hitting a card allows for you to get a card. Standing gives the dealer a card.
Your goal is to have 21 points with the cards you obtained. However, if you\n have less than 21 points, you can allow the dealer to hit (standing)
If you have more points then him when he plays you win. If not you loose.\n Simple right? Also there is gambling involved, you can opt out.
If you gamble $50 you get 100 back if you win, or loose it all.
Are you ready to play? [\"Y\" followed by enter key when ready]
